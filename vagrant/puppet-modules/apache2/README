Apache2
=======

This module configures Apache2.
It has been developed under Ubuntu 10.04.

It is able to setup:
- apache2
- ssl configuration for Apache
- modules
- create websites

Conventions
-----------
This modules is making user of standard Debian/Ubuntu conventions for websites and modules handling (sites-enabled, mods-enabled...)

However to provide a greater level of clarity, websites are organised in subfolders per domain.

Depending on the value of $multiple_client, the Apache config folder tree will be either
- true:  $apache2_root/sites-available/$client/$site_domain/$website
- false: $apache2_root/sites-available/$domain/$website
This is also valid for the log folder tree in /var/log/apache2

Also even though modules can be managed directly using the provided define, the idea is to ensure that a website declaration indicates the module it needs to run (explicit style)

Dependencies
------------

* Concat git://github.com/ripienaar/puppet-concat.git
* SSL module if using https
