Packages
=======

This module does nothing on its own.
It is a dependency for package mangement for some other modules.
It has been created because of the uniqueness requirements of Puppet regarding
resources declaration.

It is aimed at managing packages that are used in multiple modules.
Ex: libdbd_mysql_perl, python_memcache etc...

In the end, this package declares virtual pakcage statement resources.
